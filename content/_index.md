## A Brief History

The **#GrabYourWallet** movement began in the wake of the release of the Access Hollywood tape when two women simultaneously realized they could no longer in good conscience do business with companies doing business with the Trump family. 

Never having met, Shannon Coulter and Sue Atencio joined forces on October 11, 2016 and announced on Twitter they'd be boycotting any retailer that carried Trump products. They published a short list of such retailers later that same evening and on October 14th, Shannon introduced the **#GrabYourWallet** hashtag. 

The hashtag exploded on social media and has been viewed over a billion times. More than 35 companies have severed ties with the Trump family since the boycott began including Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Jet, Carnival Cruise, and Kawasaki. (To see the full list, see "[Which Companies Have Been Dropped](/which_companies_have_been_dropped/)" section of this site.) 

In 2017, **#GrabYourWallet** expanded in scope and now serves as a broader tool for the flexing of consumer power in favor of a safer, more respectful, more inclusive society. The **#GrabYourWallet** movement has been covered by The New York Times, Vogue, Teen Vogue, Washington Post, NPR, The Guardian, BBC, Cosmopolitan, CNN, MSNBC, and Nightline among many other media outlets (see [Media Coverage](/media_coverage/)). 

Notable figures who have amplified or supported the movement include Don Cheadle, Greg Louganis, Lucy Lawless, Roseanne Cash, Neko Case, Joyce Carol Oates, Robert Reich, Pam Grier, George Clinton, John Leguizamo, Rob Corddry and Ben Cohen (of Ben & Jerry's).

## About The #GrabYourWallet List

Since its first humble incarnation as a screenshot on October 11th, the **#GrabYourWallet** boycott list has grown as a centralized resource for the flexing of consumer power in favor of a safer, more respectful, more inclusive society. 

On November 23rd, the official **#GrabYourWallet** boycott list moved from a public Google doc to grabyourwallet.org. A small GYW team carefully monitors the companies on the list and immediately removes them once a company has taken the recommended action.
