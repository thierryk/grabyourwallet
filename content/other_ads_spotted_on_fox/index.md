This part of the site was created during the Roy Moore scandal in order to track advertisers that appear on Fox News, which "at the time" was promoting a skewed narrative designed to politicize the issue of sexual harassment and undermine Moore's accusers. For example, it ran a story entitled "Roy Moore accuser worked for Clinton campaign" and failed to mention that the company of the accuser in question "a sign language interpretation service" had also provided services to Republican campaigns and candidates.
