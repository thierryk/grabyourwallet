**Please note**: the companies listed below are NOT on the boycott list. They are presented as ALTERNATIVES to the companies on the boycott list. (For the companies we're boycotting, see the [Boycott these Companies](/boycott_these_companies/) page.)

Although we have conducted online searches to ensure these retailers do not sell Trump brand products, the political donation activities of their board & C-suite members were not investigated prior to creating this portion of the list. We hope to be able to conduct this research as the GYW effort expands and formalizes in 2018.

**Why aren't stores like Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters, and Terrain on the list above?**

Richard Hayne is the CEO of Urban Outfitters, part of the URBN family of companies that include Anthropologie, Free People, BHLDN, and Terrain. Although records indicate that he did not donate directly to Donald Trump, he has donated to Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (who endorsed Trump) as well as former US Senator Rick Santorum (who acted as an appointed advisor to Trump during his campaign and helped sell Trump to portions of the Christian community.) The URBN family of companies originally appeared on the "Shop These Trump-Free Alternatives" portion of the #GrabYourWallet list, but upon learning of Hayne's political donation activities, were removed.
