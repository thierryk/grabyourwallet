**Note**: this is the FYI area of the #GrabYourWallet site, which is a separate area from the main boycott portion. As of February 2018, companies with corporate PACs that have recently contributed money to NRA-approved U.S. senators and/or their campaigns are included in this portion of the list. These companies are in **_italic_** and **bold**.
