## Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly

Why Do They Appear on This List?
: NBC News' Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly aired an interview with controversial talk radio personality Alex Jones, who has claimed that mass shooting incidents such as Sandy Hook Elementary School are hoaxes. Both Executive Producer Liz Cole (liz.cole@nbcuni.com) and Megyn Kelly herself defended the interview. GrabYourWallet reached out to the reported sponsors of this showto ask if they objected to Kelly giving a national platform to a conspiracy theorist. Many #GrabYourWallet participants chose to reach out to these advertisers not as a matter of partisan politics, but as one of legitimizing an unethical media personality prone to spreading false information for hyper-partisan purposes. The public pressure applied by #GrabYourWallet participants and others resulted in NBC News adding the voices of Sandy Hook parents and other balancing elements to the piece.
