<h2 id="grabyourwallet-action-guide">#GrabYourWallet Action Guide</h2>

<p>The goal of the #GrabYourWallet boycott is to motivate companies to take specific actions to evolve in a more ethical inclusive direction. This is so we can remove them from the boycott list and return as customers as quickly as possible! Over 30 companies have already been removed from the list. Here are some ways you can make sure even more can be removed.</p>

<p><strong>In order of priority:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><h3 id="send-an-email-to-the-company-s-pr-team">Send an email to the company&rsquo;s PR team</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;P&rdquo; in PR stands for public and that&rsquo;s you, so make yourself heard. PR professionals are sensitive to branding and reputation related issues, they&rsquo;re usually in a better position to recommend the company makes changes than customer service team members, and unlike a phone call emails can be easily forwarded &amp; documented, so if you&rsquo;re only going to contact the company in one specific way, make it this one.</p></li>

<li><h3 id="send-an-email-to-customer-service">Send an email to customer service</h3>

<p>Experts recommend sending an email over making a phone call because emails can easily be forwarded to management. Many people choose to start with this sample wording, then customize from there.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a sample of what to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi. <br>Iâ€™m a longtime customer / fan of your company.
<br>Unfortunately I&rsquo;ll no longer be able to (do business with you because you [do business with the Trump family / advertise on Fox News]. <br>If you were to no longer do so I would enthusiastically return as a customer. <br>Please communicate my feedback to management.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><h3 id="fill-out-the-company-s-third-party-feedback-form">Fill out the company&rsquo;s third party feedback form</h3>

<p>The customer feedback companies receive from third party data collectors is very influential over their decisions, so if you&rsquo;re getting in touch with a big retailer, use this to your advantage!</p>

<p>Not all of the companies on the list will have this option, but if they do, there&rsquo;s typically a link at the very bottom of the main web page that says something like &ldquo;give us feedback.&rdquo; Most retailers have this option.</p></li>

<li><h3 id="call-the-companies-on-the-list">Call the companies on the list</h3>

<p>Start with the companies with which you have a genuine connection as a customer and move on from there if you choose. If you can only contact a few companies on the list, that&rsquo;s fine! If you&rsquo;re not prepared to boycott a company, but would just like to express your concern, that&rsquo;s great too. The professionals with whom you speak tend to be VERY polite and receptive when receiving such calls. Your call is most effective when you use a polite tone too. Don&rsquo;t worry that you&rsquo;re being confrontational by calling them. As long as you keep your tone respectful, calls tend to be quick &amp; pleasant.</p></li>

<li><h3 id="use-social-media-to-address-the-companies-on-the-list">Use social media to address the companies on the list</h3>

<p>Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are the three most popular ways to use social media to get the attention of the companies on the list. Be sure to tag in the company&rsquo;s name using the @ sign, so they see it. Use the <strong>#GrabYourWallet</strong> hashtag and/or the Twitter handle <a href="https://twitter.com/shannoncoulter">@shannoncoulter</a> for possible retweeting!
<br>Sample Tweets:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love shopping with you <a href="https://twitter.com/amazon">@Amazon</a> but can&rsquo;t anymore until you stop advertising on Breitbart &amp; drop Trump brand products. #GrabYourWallet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Will return to being a dedicated <a href="https://twitter.com/geico">@Geico</a> customer just as soon as it stops advertising on Fox News. #GrabYourWallet</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><h3 id="share-the-grabyourwallet-list-with-your-family-friends">Share the #GrabYourWallet list with your family &amp; friends</h3>

<p>Shoot them a quick text or email to send them to <a href="http://grabyourwallet.org">grabyourwallet.org</a>. Encourage them to reach out to their favorite companies on the list.</p></li>
