It is not known at this time why Gilt is no longer selling these items, although it should be emphasized that Gilt is a flash sale site & inventory tends to be more volatile w/ such companies than with more traditional retailers. That said, Gilt's Trump Home inventory had remained stable since the beginning of the boycott.

### Neiman Marcus

Date Dropped

Racked published a story on this, stating that Neiman had decided not to carry the line this season. Neiman issued a statement: "Neiman Marcus has a very small Ivanka Trump precious jewelry business which is compromised 100 percent of consigned merchandise. Based on productivity we continuously assess whether our brands are carried in stores, on our website, or both." On Feb 3rd, Neiman was removed from the boycott list, the 9th company to be removed. On 3/8/17, however, #GrabYourWallet participants noticed two new Ivanka jewelry items on the Neiman site, so the store was briefly re-added to the boycott list. The products, however, quickly disappeared from the site (within 24 hours) and in the interim the Ivanka Trump brand made a statement that it is discontinuing its fine jewelry line altogether which was the only line Neiman carried, so the retailer was re-removed from the list.
